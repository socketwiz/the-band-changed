                                    Aaron started playing guitar at age eighteen&nbsp;and was greatly
                                    influenced by the 60's guitar players (Clapton, Hendrix and Page).
                                    His musical preference is the 90's alternative genre,<br></p>
                                    <p><br></p>
                                    <p>&quot;because I like the variety and creativity I
                                        find there&quot;.<br></p>
                                    <p><br></p>
                                    <p>He grew up attending Stephens City, (Virginia) United Methodist
                                        as his home&nbsp;church. It was there during his teen and college
                                        years that&nbsp;he began attending a few other churches as well.
                                        Aaron admits that while he was searching for "life's meaning"
                                        &nbsp;at one point he stopped going to church altogether.<br></p>
                                    <p><br></p>
                                    <p>During that spiritual dry spell (which lasted a few years), his
                                        mother convinced&nbsp;him to play guitar at his old
                                        home&nbsp;church's contemporary worship service, Aaron&nbsp;has
                                        been faithfully doing that for many years now.<br></p>
                                    <p><br></p>
                                    <p>&quot;I enjoy playing Christian contemporary
                                        because of the positive message, people and opportunities that
                                        comes with the band experience".<br></p>

                                    <p>"The Band&nbsp;Changed has made a big difference in my life as
                                        it has allowed me to connect&nbsp;with God and some great
                                        individual musicians. It has been a spiritual awakening and a

                                        take pride in the message, music, and fellowship in The Band

                                    <br>
                                    Rob Talton was born and raised in Orlando, Florida. Brought up
                                    by&nbsp;his loving and supportive parents,&nbsp;It was there Rob
                                    &nbsp;developed a love for music at a very young age.&nbsp; His
                                    parents filled the family home with music, and his love for music
                                    was nurtured by everyone in his family.&nbsp; Rob plays the piano,
                                    keyboards, bass guitar, and guitar.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                                    <br>
                                    &quot;My grandmother purchased something called a
                                    'Chord Organ', when I was 7
                                    years old...My parents were away for the weekend,
                                    and my grandmother taught me to play 'Amazing
                                    Grace' and 'Onward Christian
                                    Soldiers' before the end of the weekend.&nbsp;
                                    It was my grandmother that identified that I had an ear for
                                    music.&nbsp; I am so grateful for the love and support that I had
                                    as a child.&quot;<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Rob began playing music professionally in 1991 in Jacksonville, Fl.
                                    &nbsp;playing&nbsp;at coffee houses, bookstore caf&eacute;s,
                                    and clubs as a solo performer. &nbsp;He&nbsp;also played with his
                                    Fusion band &quot;Focus&quot;. &nbsp;Leading
                                    his own family, Rob took a break from playing music on a
                                    professional level for 15 years.&nbsp;<br>
                                    <br>
                                    &quot;A few years&nbsp;years ago, I will say that I
                                    had something laid upon my heart, and that was to play music
                                    again...music that honors God.&nbsp; I felt a
                                    call to form a band, made up of talented musicians whose hearts
                                    were all in agreement.&nbsp; We now have a great
                                    band...friends, brothers, and sisters in the
                                    faith.&nbsp; I felt this call to take this music to the
                                    streets....out in the community, where people
                                    would not expect to hear music with this kind of message.&nbsp; Our
                                    message is Hope, Grace, Redemption, and for people to know that no
                                    matter who you are, or what you've done, or
                                    where you've come from, or where you are now,
                                    there is a God that loves you and wants to change your
                                    life.&quot;</p>

                                    From Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, Dan started playing music in 1963 and
                                    was totally immersed in the music culture.<br></p>
                                    <p><br></p>
                                    <p>&quot;I lived to play and the 60's and 70's were
                                        exciting times. "I came into a relationship with Jesus after many
                                        years of resistance. But, when I made the commitment, it was deep
                                        and wide (as the kid's song goes). My testimony of God's saving
                                        grace is proof that God truly does love everyone!"<br></p>

                                    <p>Musically, he switched from those years of secular music to
                                        Jesus music the moment he accepted Christ. He was radically
                                        saved.<br></p>

                                    Paul grew up in the mountains of North Carolina&nbsp;where his
                                    parents brought him up in a mountain Baptist Church. As he grew in
                                    faith, he came to accept for himself the gift of salvation through
                                    Christ's death and resurrection.<br></p>
                                    <p><br></p>
                                    <p>&quot;I have found looking back that the Holy
                                        Spirit has truly been my comforter in times of trouble and that God
                                        has provided life in abundance&quot;.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        His first musical exposure was listening to his&nbsp;parents'
                                        southern gospel, country music and bluegrass records. When he began
                                        to develop his own taste in music, at first&nbsp;it was mostly
                                        Michael Jackson. &quot;thankfully, I had
                                        friends&nbsp;who&nbsp;introduced me to bands like Guns and Roses
                                        and Aerosmith&quot;. He started playing guitar when he was a
                                        senior in high school. The school principal would allow students to
                                        bring guitars and meet at lunch to trade licks. There he learned
                                        about Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, and Nirvana.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        In college he was part of a student lead Christian group and played
                                        praise music for the gatherings. It was at these meetings where he
                                        met his wife Rachel, who also played guitar. He also discovered
                                        Christian Rock (Third Day, Jars of Clay, Switchfoot, etc.), The
                                        Allman Brothers Band and Stevie Ray Vaughan.<br></p>
                                        <p><br></p>
                                        <p>&quot;At church I was blessed to play with a
                                            couple of great guitarists, including my former high school
                                            principal. We played mostly bluegrass and I learned a lot about
                                            rhythm guitar along the way.&quot;<br></p>
                                        <p><br></p>
                                        <p>During college, he became part of a band called Seven
                                            Strangers.<br></p>
                                        <p><br></p>
                                        <p>&quot;We played at local churches and eventually
                                            made a CD. We even took a week one summer and toured the great
                                            state of North Carolina with a stop or two in South
                                            Carolina.&quot;<br></p>
                                        <p><br></p>
                                        <p>College ended and Seven Strangers ended as well.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            A few years later he and his wife moved to Austin, Texas, where
                                            Rachel attended&nbsp;seminary.<br></p>
                                            <p><br></p>
                                            <p>&quot;Austin was a great town to live in as a
                                                guitar player and I enjoyed seeing live music and having access to
                                                guitar stores.&quot;<br></p>
                                            <p><br></p>
                                            <p>Although he did not play out much in Austin, he started helping
                                                out with sound engineering at a large church outside of town and
                                                learned a lot through that experience. During his second year in
                                                Austin, his job became extremely stressful and he suffered a
                                                nervous breakdown.<br></p>
                                            <p><br></p>
                                            <p>&quot;I left my job and was struggling with
                                                depression and anxiety. But God surrounded me with people who
                                                supported me and helped me to heal. My wife's
                                                love and support never wavered and she pushed me out of the hermit
                                                hole at just the right times to keep me going.&quot;<br></p>
                                            <p><br></p>
                                            <p>They also had a neighbor at the time who was a single mother and
                                                needed someone to watch her baby occasionally. He was available, so
                                                she asked him to watch her daughter.<br></p>
                                            <p><br></p>
                                            <p>&quot;I honestly believe that child may have saved
                                                me in many ways because she gave glimpse into what I had to look
                                                forward to in my own life, as we were also expecting our first
                                                child at the time.&quot;<br>
                                                <br>
                                                After his daughter was born, they moved back to NC for a year, and
                                                his wife accepted a Pastor's position&nbsp;at&nbsp;a church in the
                                                Shenandoah Valley and they moved to VA. He started playing at a new
                                                service with what became unofficially known as
                                                &quot;PPR&quot;.<br></p>
                                                <p><br></p>
                                                <p>&quot;I answered a craigslist ad for a Christian
                                                    band looking for a guitarist and joined a Band called Seven X (yes
                                                    another seven). Rob Talton was also in that band which lasted for a
                                                    year or so after I joined.&quot;<br></p>
                                                <p><br></p>
                                                <p>After several months, Rob called him to come play with a new
                                                    band he was feeling lead to put together which became The Band

                                    <p>&nbsp;&quot;I never accepted him as Savior and

                                    next step I should take. The very next day, one of the band members
                                    approached me to start singing with them and I knew it was a sign
                                    from God pushing me to do what I was meant to do. I thank God for
                                    every precious gift and every blessing he has given me. I have so
                                    much to be thankful for and want to live everyday the way he wants
                                    me to live it. Life is still busy, but I know that God deserves the
                                    glory first and foremost with the gifts he has entrusted me with. I
                                    am honored to be a member of this band and I hope you are blessed

                                    was there he met a friend who played drums for the Lee Singers that
                                    inspired him&nbsp;to come home that summer, purchase a set of drums
                                    and learn to play himself. &nbsp;He's<br>

                                <p>Ricky has had the opportunity to fill in as a backup drummer for

                                    last couple of years. &nbsp;Recently an opportunity&nbsp;presented
                                    itself to audition for the band to fill the drummer role.

                                    will help me expand my abilities as a drummer as well as&nbsp;find
                                    a different way to worship and make new friends."<br>
