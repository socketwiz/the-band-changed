            <p>
                Rob Talton was born and raised in Orlando, Florida. Brought up by his
                loving and supportive parents, It was there Rob developed a love for
                music at a very young age.  His parents filled the family home with
                music, and his love for music was nurtured by everyone in his family.
                Rob plays the piano, keyboards, bass guitar, and guitar. 
            </p>
            <p>
                &quot;My grandmother purchased something called a &#39;Chord Organ&#39;, when I was
                7 years old...My parents were away for the weekend, and my grandmother
                taught me to play &#39;Amazing Grace&#39; and &#39;Onward Christian Soldiers&#39;
                before the end of the weekend.  It was my grandmother that identified
                that I had an ear for music.  I am so grateful for the love and
                support that I had as a child.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>
                Rob began playing music professionally in 1991 in Jacksonville, Fl.
                playing at coffee houses, bookstore cafés, and clubs as a solo
                performer.  He also played with his Fusion band &quot;Focus&quot;.  Leading his
                own family, Rob took a break from playing music on a professional
                level for 15 years. 
            </p>
            <p>
                &quot;A few years years ago, I will say that I had
                something laid upon my heart, and that was to play
                music again...music that honors God.  I felt a call to
                form a band, made up of talented musicians whose
                hearts were all in agreement.  We now have a great
                band...friends, brothers, and sisters in the faith.  I
                felt this call to take this music to the
                streets....out in the community, where people would
                not expect to hear music with this kind of message.
                    Our message is Hope, Grace, Redemption, and for people
                to know that no matter who you are, or what you&#39;ve
                done, or where you&#39;ve come from, or where you are now,
                there is a God that loves you and wants to change your
                life.&quot;

                className="bio-image"
                src="/images/liz-turner.jpg" />
            <p>
                Liz and her fiancé were involved in ministry as they attended a small, Southern Baptist
                church in Tallahassee, Florida. It was there they also attended college. Her next step
                was returning home to attend grad school at Shenandoah University (Winchester,
                Virginia) for physical therapy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Liz started a family with her husband Chip and they currently live in Winchester with
                their two children, Jackson and Izzy.
            </p>
            <p>
                She played piano as a young child and picked up the guitar in her early 20&#39;s, She
                connected with the guitar and learned simple chord structures to her favorite songs. It
                was Dan May who was her first guitar teacher.
            </p>
            <p>
                She served at the Winchester Church of God music and drama ministry for 10 years.
                Singing on the praise team, choir and ensemble, she wrote and directed plays for both
                adult and children’s drama. &quot;I have always loved writing and creating something that
                would move or inspire others. I would often write funny poems to friends on birthdays or
                eloquent love letters but it wasn&#39;t until I was approached by our music pastor and asked
                to write an original song about family that I considered songwriting.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>
                After writing that song, Liz couldn’t get enough. She started writing lyrics down in
                notebooks that were lying around, researching theory, deconstructing favorite songs to
                understand what made them work, and playing with words. Songwriting became a
                passion.
            </p>
            <p>
                &quot;The trust, encouragement, loyalty, and experience of my friends and band mates has
                given me the wings to grow as a singer and songwriter. I have dedicated myself to
                inspiring others through songs of real life, real struggle and real redemption&quot;.
            </p>

            <h3>Dan May</h3>

            <p>
                From Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, Dan started playing music in 1963 and
                was totally immersed in the music culture.
            </p>
            <p>
                &quot;I lived to play and the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s were exciting times.&quot; I came
                into a relationship with Jesus after many years of resistance. But,
                when I made the commitment, it was deep and wide (as the kid&#39;s song
                goes). My testimony of God&#39;s saving grace is proof that God truly does
                love everyone!&quot;
            </p>
            <p>
                Musically, he switched from those years of secular music to Jesus
                music the moment he accepted Christ. He was radically saved.
            </p>
            <p>
                &quot;I can&#39;t have my music go in a different direction than my heart. No
                regrets, never looked back.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>
                Dan has had many musical encounters throughout the years with artists
                such as Nikki Cruz, Israel Narvez, The David Wilkerson Ministries,
                Andréa Crouch, Dannibelle, Randy Matthews, Phil Keaggy, Kelly
                Washington, Mark Lowery, Tom Stanko, Darrell Dement. &quot;Really, too many
                to recall....&quot;.
            </p>
            <p>
                He&#39;s been involved in countless musical projects from bands to major
                musical productions and considers it a divine privilege to serve each
                and every moment. When not sitting in with bands, recording or
                jamming, he is fully engaged at his home church.
            </p>
            <p>
                &quot;It&#39;s a huge blessing to proclaim the awesome gift of eternal life
                through music&quot;.
            </p>
            <p>
                He and his wife Kathy reside near Winchester, Virginia, and have been
                married since 1971 with 2 daughters and 5 grandchildren and 1 great
                grandchild.
            </p>
            <p>
                &quot;It&#39;s great to rock with an anointed purpose&quot;.

                Dan recommends this Instrumental CD that he contributed on with the
                WINCOG Worship Band. Bass on all tracts except on track #9 (Where he

                className="bio-image"
                src="/images/aaron-adams.jpg" />
            <p>
                Aaron started playing guitar at age eighteen and was greatly
                influenced by the 60&#39;s guitar players (Clapton, Hendrix and Page). His
                musical preference is the 90&#39;s alternative genre,
            </p>
            <p>
                &quot;Because I like the variety and creativity I find there&quot;.
            </p>
            <p>
                He grew up attending Stephens City, (Virginia) United Methodist as his
                home church. It was there during his teen and college years that he
                began attending a few other churches as well. Aaron admits that while
                he was searching for &quot;life&#39;s meaning&quot; at one point he stopped going to
                church altogether.
            </p>
            <p>
                During that spiritual dry spell (which lasted a few years), his mother
                convinced him to play guitar at his old home church&#39;s contemporary
                worship service, Aaron has been faithfully doing that for many years
                now.
            </p>
            <p>
                &quot;I enjoy playing Christian contemporary because of the positive
                message, people and opportunities that comes with the band
                experience&quot;.
            </p>
            <p>
                &quot;The Band Changed has made a big difference in my life as it has
                allowed me to connect with God and some great individual musicians. It
                has been a spiritual awakening and a musical reboot and recharge. I
                needed that. I take pride in the message, music, and fellowship in The
                Band Changed.&quot;

            <h3>Paul Crumley</h3>

                className="bio-image"
                src="/images/paul-crumley.jpg" />
            <p>
                Paul grew up in the mountains of North Carolina where his parents
                brought him up in a mountain Baptist Church. As he grew in faith, he
                came to accept for himself the gift of salvation through Christ&#39;s
                death and resurrection.
            </p>
            <p>
                &quot;I have found looking back that the Holy Spirit has truly been my
                comforter in times of trouble and that God has provided life in
                abundance&quot;.
            </p>
            <p>
                His first musical exposure was listening to his parents&#39; southern
                gospel, country music and bluegrass records. When he began to develop
                his own taste in music, at first it was mostly Michael
                Jackson. &quot;thankfully, I had friends who introduced me to bands like
                Guns and Roses and Aerosmith&quot;. He started playing guitar when he was a
                senior in high school. The school principal would allow students to
                bring guitars and meet at lunch to trade licks. There he learned about
                Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, and Nirvana.
            </p>
            <p>
                In college he was part of a student lead Christian group and played
                praise music for the gatherings. It was at these meetings where he met
                his wife Rachel, who also played guitar. He also discovered Christian
                Rock (Third Day, Jars of Clay, Switchfoot, etc.), The Allman Brothers
                Band and Stevie Ray Vaughan.
            </p>
            <p>
                &quot;At church I was blessed to play with a couple of great guitarists,
                including my former high school principal. We played mostly bluegrass
                and I learned a lot about rhythm guitar along the way.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>
                During college, he became part of a band called Seven Strangers.
            </p>
            <p>
                &quot;We played at local churches and eventually made a CD. We even took a
                week one summer and toured the great state of North Carolina with a
                stop or two in South Carolina.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>College ended and Seven Strangers ended as well. </p>
            <p>
                A few years later he and his wife moved to Austin, Texas, where Rachel
                attended seminary.
            </p>
            <p>
                &quot;Austin was a great town to live in as a guitar player and I enjoyed
                seeing live music and having access to guitar stores.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>
                Although he did not play out much in Austin, he started helping out
                with sound engineering at a large church outside of town and learned a
                lot through that experience. During his second year in Austin, his job
                became extremely stressful and he suffered a nervous breakdown.
            </p>
            <p>
                &quot;I left my job and was struggling with depression and anxiety. But God
                surrounded me with people who supported me and helped me to heal. My
                wife&#39;s love and support never wavered and she pushed me out of the
                hermit hole at just the right times to keep me going.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>
                They also had a neighbor at the time who was a single mother and
                needed someone to watch her baby occasionally. He was available, so
                she asked him to watch her daughter.
            </p>
            <p>
                &quot;I honestly believe that child may have saved me in many ways because
                she gave glimpse into what I had to look forward to in my own life, as
                we were also expecting our first child at the time.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>
                After his daughter was born, they moved back to NC for a year, and his
                wife accepted a Pastor&#39;s position at a church in the Shenandoah Valley
                and they moved to VA. He started playing at a new service with what
                became unofficially known as &quot;PPR&quot;.
            </p>
            <p>
                &quot;I answered a craigslist ad for a Christian band looking for a
                guitarist and joined a Band called Seven X (yes another seven). Rob
                Talton was also in that band which lasted for a year or so after I
                joined.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>
                After several months, Rob called him to come play with a new band he
                was feeling lead to put together which became The Band Changed.

            <img alt="Jessica Witherspoon"
                className="bio-image"
                src="/images/jessica-witherspoon.jpg" />
            <p>
                Jessica remembered when she was 4 or 5 singing at church for the first
                time and knew it was a special calling in her life. She asked Christ
                into her life when she was very young and constantly asked for his
                hand and guidance with everything she did. Her passion began to grow
                when she started playing the piano and creating her own songs at a
                young age.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a teenager, she sang in the youth praise band at church and lead
                worship on Wednesday nights. Her and her husband (Michael) met at
                church, where he played guitar in the same band.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jessica finished her education degree at St. Petersburg College in
                Florida and shortly after that, was married to Michael. During their
                time in Florida, they led the youth in praise and worship and also
                taught &quot;Kids Church&quot; on Sunday mornings. Jessica and Michael moved
                back to Winchester where Jessica is currently the librarian at Indian
                Hollow Elementary. They have a son, Isaac, who inspires her and
                challenges her daily to be the best mother, friend, daughter and
                Christian.
            </p>
            <p>
                During her life&#39;s journey, Jessica felt that she was not totally
                committed to glorifying God to the fullest and was letting the
                &quot;busyness&quot; of life get the best of her.
            </p>
            <p>
                &quot;I knew that God was calling me to something greater and I was
                frustrated because I was unsure of the next step I should take. The
                very next day, one of the band members approached me to start singing
                with them and I knew it was a sign from God pushing me to do what I
                was meant to do. I thank God for every precious gift and every
                blessing he has given me. I have so much to be thankful for and want
                to live everyday the way he wants me to live it. Life is still busy,
                but I know that God deserves the glory first and foremost with the
                gifts he has entrusted me with. I am honored to be a member of this
                band and I hope you are blessed and changed by our message&quot;
            </p>

                Ricky grew up in the Baptist church in his home town of Leesburg,
                Florida. In high school, he started attending the Church of God and
                ended up going to Lee College for a year. It was there he met a friend
                who played drums for the Lee Singers that inspired him to come home
                that summer, purchase a set of drums and learn to play himself.  He&#39;s
                been playing drums for the Winchester Church of God in Virginia for
                over 20 years now. &quot;It&#39;s a blessing to be able to participate in the
                church band with so many talented and interesting musicians all of
                like faith.&quot;

                He and his wife of over 20 years reside in Winchester, Virginia with
                their 2 children. Other than playing the drums he enjoys riding
                motorcycles, watching movies, and playing video games.

                Ricky has had the opportunity to fill in as a backup drummer for
                rehearsals from time to time for The Band Changed over the last couple
                of years.  Recently an opportunity presented itself to audition for
                the band to fill the drummer role.  Eventually he was selected to
                become the new drummer. &quot;I&#39;m excited about this new opportunity and
                the change of pace from church playing. I&#39;m hoping this challenge will
                help me expand my abilities as a drummer as well as find a different
                way to worship and make new friends.&quot;
