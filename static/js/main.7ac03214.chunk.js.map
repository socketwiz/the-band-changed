His parents filled the family home with\n                music, and his love for music was nurtured by everyone in his family.\n                Rob plays the piano, keyboards, bass guitar, and guitar. \n            </p>\n            <p>\n                &quot;My grandmother purchased something called a &#39;Chord Organ&#39;, when I was\n                7 years old...My parents were away for the weekend, and my grandmother\n                taught me to play &#39;Amazing Grace&#39; and &#39;Onward Christian Soldiers&#39;\n                before the end of the weekend.  It was my grandmother that identified\n                that I had an ear for music.

I felt a call to\n                form a band, made up of talented musicians whose\n                hearts were all in agreement.

It was there they also attended college. Her next step\n                was returning home to attend grad school at Shenandoah University (Winchester,\n                Virginia) for physical therapy.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                Liz started a family with her husband Chip and they currently live in Winchester with\n                their two children, Jackson and Izzy.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                She played piano as a young child and picked up the guitar in her early 20&#39;s, She\n                connected with the guitar and learned simple chord structures to her favorite songs.

I would often write funny poems to friends on birthdays or\n                eloquent love letters but it wasn&#39;t until I was approached by our music pastor and asked\n                to write an original song about family that I considered songwriting.&quot;\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                After writing that song, Liz couldn’t get enough. She started writing lyrics down in\n                notebooks that were lying around, researching theory, deconstructing favorite songs to\n                understand what made them work, and playing with words.

But,\n                when I made the commitment, it was deep and wide (as the kid&#39;s song\n                goes).

He also discovered Christian\n                Rock (Third Day, Jars of Clay, Switchfoot, etc.), The Allman Brothers\n                Band and Stevie Ray Vaughan.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                &quot;At church I was blessed to play with a couple of great guitarists,\n                including my former high school principal. We played mostly bluegrass\n                and I learned a lot about rhythm guitar along the way.&quot;\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                During college, he became part of a band called Seven Strangers.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                &quot;We played at local churches and eventually made a CD. We even took a\n                week one summer and toured the great state of North Carolina with a\n                stop or two in South Carolina.&quot;\n            </p>\n            <p>College ended and Seven Strangers ended as well. </p>\n            <p>\n                A few years later he and his wife moved to Austin, Texas, where Rachel\n                attended seminary.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                &quot;Austin was a great town to live in as a guitar player and I enjoyed\n                seeing live music and having access to guitar stores.&quot;\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                Although he did not play out much in Austin, he started helping out\n                with sound engineering at a large church outside of town and learned a\n                lot through that experience. During his second year in Austin, his job\n                became extremely stressful and he suffered a nervous breakdown.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                &quot;I left my job and was struggling with depression and anxiety. But God\n                surrounded me with people who supported me and helped me to heal. My\n                wife&#39;s love and support never wavered and she pushed me out of the\n                hermit hole at just the right times to keep me going.&quot;\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                They also had a neighbor at the time who was a single mother and\n                needed someone to watch her baby occasionally. He was available, so\n                she asked him to watch her daughter.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                &quot;I honestly believe that child may have saved me in many ways because\n                she gave glimpse into what I had to look forward to in my own life, as\n                we were also expecting our first child at the time.&quot;\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                After his daughter was born, they moved back to NC for a year, and his\n                wife accepted a Pastor&#39;s position at a church in the Shenandoah Valley\n                and they moved to VA. He started playing at a new service with what\n                became unofficially known as &quot;PPR&quot;.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                &quot;I answered a craigslist ad for a Christian band looking for a\n                guitarist and joined a Band called Seven X (yes another seven). Rob\n                Talton was also in that band which lasted for a year or so after I\n                joined.&quot;\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                After several months, Rob called him to come play with a new band he\n                was feeling lead to put together which became The Band Changed.\n            </p>\n\n            <h3>Jessica Witherspoon</h3>\n            <img alt=\"Jessica Witherspoon\"\n                className=\"bio-image\"\n                src=\"/images/jessica-witherspoon.jpg\" />\n            <p>\n                Jessica remembered when she was 4 or 5 singing at church for the first\n                time and knew it was a special calling in her life. She asked Christ\n                into her life when she was very young and constantly asked for his\n                hand and guidance with everything she did. Her passion began to grow\n                when she started playing the piano and creating her own songs at a\n                young age.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                As a teenager, she sang in the youth praise band at church and lead\n                worship on Wednesday nights. Her and her husband (Michael) met at\n                church, where he played guitar in the same band.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                Jessica finished her education degree at St. Petersburg College in\n                Florida and shortly after that, was married to Michael. During their\n                time in Florida, they led the youth in praise and worship and also\n                taught &quot;Kids Church&quot; on Sunday mornings. Jessica and Michael moved\n                back to Winchester where Jessica is currently the librarian at Indian\n                Hollow Elementary. They have a son, Isaac, who inspires her and\n                challenges her daily to be the best mother, friend, daughter and\n                Christian.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                During her life&#39;s journey, Jessica felt that she was not totally\n                committed to glorifying God to the fullest and was letting the\n                &quot;busyness&quot; of life get the best of her.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                &quot;I knew that God was calling me to something greater and I was\n                frustrated because I was unsure of the next step I should take. The\n                very next day, one of the band members approached me to start singing\n                with them and I knew it was a sign from God pushing me to do what I\n                was meant to do. I thank God for every precious gift and every\n                blessing he has given me. I have so much to be thankful for and want\n                to live everyday the way he wants me to live it. Life is still busy,\n                but I know that God deserves the glory first and foremost with the\n                gifts he has entrusted me with. I am honored to be a member of this\n                band and I hope you are blessed and changed by our message&quot;\n            </p>\n\n            <h3>Ricky Nelson</h3>\n            <img alt=\"Ricky Nelson\"\n                className=\"bio-image\"\n                src=\"/images/ricky-nelson.jpg\" />\n            <p>\n                Ricky grew up in the Baptist church in his home town of Leesburg,\n                Florida. In high school, he started attending the Church of God and\n                ended up going to Lee College for a year. It was there he met a friend\n                who played drums for the Lee Singers that inspired him to come home\n                that summer, purchase a set of drums and learn to play himself.  He&#39;s\n                been playing drums for the Winchester Church of God in Virginia for\n                over 20 years now. &quot;It&#39;s a blessing to be able to participate in the\n                church band with so many talented and interesting musicians all of\n                like faith.&quot;\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                He and his wife of over 20 years reside in Winchester, Virginia with\n                their 2 children. Other than playing the drums he enjoys riding\n                motorcycles, watching movies, and playing video games.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                Ricky has had the opportunity to fill in as a backup drummer for\n                rehearsals from time to time for The Band Changed over the last couple\n                of years.  Recently an opportunity presented itself to audition for\n                the band to fill the drummer role.  Eventually he was selected to\n                become the new drummer. &quot;I&#39;m excited about this new opportunity and\n                the change of pace from church playing. I&#39;m hoping this challenge will\n                help me expand my abilities as a drummer as well as find a different\n                way to worship and make new friends.&quot;\n            </p>\n        </Main>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default BandBios;\n","\nimport './contact.css';\n\nimport {Alert} from 'react-bootstrap';\nimport {Button, Form, TextArea, TextInput} from 'rwidgets';\nimport Main from '../../layouts/main';\nimport PropTypes from 'prop-types';\nimport React, {Component} from 'react';\n\nclass ContactUs extends Component {\n    constructor(props) {\n        super(props);\n\n        this.state = {\n            'alertVisible': false\n        };\n    }\n\n    onSendMessage(event) {\n        const {sendMessage} = this.props;\n\n        if (typeof sendMessage === 'function') {\n            sendMessage(event)\n                .then(() => {\n                    this.setState({'alertVisible': true});\n\n                    const name = document.querySelector('#name');\n                    const email = document.querySelector('#email');\n                    const updates = document.querySelector('#updates');\n                    const subject = document.querySelector('#subject');\n                    const message = document.querySelector('#message');\n\n                    name.value = '';\n                    email.value = '';\n                    updates.checked = false;\n                    subject.value = '';\n                    message.value = '';\n                })\n                .catch(error => {\n                    console.error(error);\n                });\n        }\n    }\n\n    onCloseAlert(event) {\n        this.setState({'alertVisible': false});\n    }\n\n    validateRequired(values) {\n        const validateField = field => {\n            return field ?
